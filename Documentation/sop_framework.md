# S&OP Framework Overview

## Introduction
Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP) is a strategic business process that aligns demand and supply planning with business objectives. This framework provides a comprehensive approach to managing demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and operational performance.

## Framework Components

### 1. Demand Planning
- **Historical Analysis**: Analyzing past sales patterns and trends

- **Statistical Forecasting**: Using time series and regression models
- **Machine Learning**: Advanced algorithms for pattern recognition
- **Collaborative Planning**: Input from sales, marketing, and operations teams

### 2. Supply Planning
- **Capacity Management**: Ensuring adequate production and distribution capacity
- **Supplier Coordination**: Managing supplier relationships and lead times
- **Production Scheduling**: Optimizing manufacturing schedules
- **Distribution Planning**: Coordinating warehouse and transportation resources

### 3. Inventory Optimization
- **ABC Analysis**: Categorizing products by importance and value
- **Safety Stock**: Determining optimal buffer inventory levels
- **Reorder Points**: Calculating when to replenish inventory
- **Economic Order Quantity**: Optimizing order sizes for cost efficiency

### 4. Integrated Optimization
- **Cross-functional Alignment**: Ensuring all departments work toward common goals
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracking key indicators across the value chain
- **Scenario Planning**: Evaluating different business scenarios
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular review and optimization cycles
