# S&OP Methodology

This document describes the methodology used in the S&OP Demand & Inventory Performance Tracker.

## Overview
The S&OP (Sales & Operations Planning) methodology implemented in this project follows industry best practices for demand planning, inventory optimization, and performance tracking.

## Data Sources
- **Orders Data**: Historical transaction data including customer segments, regional distribution, and temporal patterns
- **Inventory Data**: Current stock levels, warehouse locations, and inventory valuations
- **Forecast Data**: Predictive models using statistical, manual, and machine learning approaches
- **Product Data**: Product catalog with categorization and performance metrics

## Modeling Techniques

### Demand Forecasting
1. **Statistical Models**: Time series analysis using ARIMA and exponential smoothing
2. **Machine Learning**: Advanced algorithms including Random Forest and Neural Networks
3. **Manual Forecasting**: Expert-driven predictions for new products and special events

### Inventory Optimization
- ABC analysis for product categorization
- Safety stock calculations based on demand variability
- Reorder point optimization using service level targets

### Performance Metrics
- **Forecast Accuracy**: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- **Inventory Turnover**: Revenue-to-inventory ratios
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Order fulfillment rates and delivery performance

## Validation Framework
- Historical backtesting with 12-month rolling windows
- Cross-validation across product categories and regions
- Statistical significance testing for model improvements

## Business Impact
- Improved forecast accuracy leading to reduced stockouts
- Optimized inventory levels reducing carrying costs
- Enhanced decision-making through integrated dashboards
